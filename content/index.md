# Esteban Foucher

Engineer & physicist – École Normale Supérieure Ulm (class of 2020)

Engineer and physicist trained at École Normale Supérieure Ulm, I work at the intersection of simulation, data, and applied physics. I am currently a thermo-hydraulic simulation engineer at Jimmy Energy, where I contribute to nuclear reactor conception. In parallel, I develop an embedded computer-vision system for aerodynamic measurements.
