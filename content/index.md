# Esteban Foucher

Engineer & physicist – École Normale Supérieure Ulm (class of 2020)

As a “full‑stack scientist” engineer, my physics background and professional experience allow me to tackle a wide range of scientific topics, from theory to software and hardware. I am currently a thermo‑hydraulic simulation engineer at Jimmy Energy. In parallel I am developing an embedded computer‑vision system dedicated to aerodynamic measurements.
