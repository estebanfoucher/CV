Engineer, physicist – École Normale Supérieure Ulm (class of 2020)

Engineer and physicist trained at École Normale Supérieure Ulm, I work at the intersection of simulation, data, and applied physics. I am currently a thermo-hydraulic simulation engineer at Jimmy Energy, where I contribute to reactor conception. In parallel, I develop an embedded computer-vision system for aerodynamic measurements.

## Professional Experience

### 2025 — Thermo‑hydraulic Simulation Engineer, Jimmy Energy

Currently:

- Thermo‑hydraulic simulations (computational fluid dynamics)

Internship:

- Support for reactor design engineering and safety
- Exploratory simulations of chemical kinetics under irradiation

My experience at Jimmy includes an initial internship in 2023–2024, followed by joining the simulations team again in 2025.

### 2024 — Data & Performance Engineer, Orient Express Racing Team

- Data engineering & analysis for performance of the AC40 and AC75 racing yachts  
- Data science: development of a post‑processing wind‑reconstruction tool and an optimizer for calibration  
- Collaboration with the mechatronics team for debugging and performance follow‑up

My time at OERT covers in particular the phase of commissioning of the AC75 and participation in the 37th America’s Cup.

## Projects

### SailCV – Embedded computer‑vision for aerodynamic measurements

Motivated by my experience in the sailing world, I am developing in my spare time an embedded computer‑vision project dedicated to aerodynamic measurements.

The project is divided into two sub‑projects:

#### SailCV – tell‑tale‑tracker

Design of a tell‑tale tracker to monitor boundary‑layer separation. Creation of a dataset and fine‑tuning of a detector.

#### SailCV – 3D‑reconstruction

This project aims to accurately reconstruct metric point clouds from calibrated stereo views. It is based on two main components:

- the ability of recent AI models dedicated to 3D reconstruction to predict dense point correspondences between two views of the same object;  
- precise calibration of the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a dual‑camera system, enabling accurate triangulation.
