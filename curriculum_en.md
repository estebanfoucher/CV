Engineer, physicist – École Normale Supérieure Ulm (class of 2020)

“Full‑stack scientist” engineer: my physics background and professional experience allow me to tackle a wide range of scientific topics, from theory to software and hardware.  
I am currently a thermo‑hydraulic simulation engineer at Jimmy Energy. In parallel I am developing an embedded computer‑vision system dedicated to aerodynamic measurements.

## **Professional Experience**

### **2025 — Thermo‑hydraulic Simulation Engineer, Jimmy Energy**

Today:
- Thermo‑hydraulic simulations (computational fluid dynamics)

Internship:
- Support for reactor design engineering and safety
- Exploratory simulations of chemical kinetics under irradiation

My experience at Jimmy includes an initial internship in 2023–2024, followed by joining the simulations team again in 2025.

### **2024 — Data & Performance Engineer, Orient Express Racing Team**

- Data engineering & analysis for performance analysis of the AC40 and AC75 racing yachts  
- Data science: development of a post‑processing wind‑reconstruction tool and an optimizer for calibration  
- Collaboration with the mechatronics team for debugging and performance follow‑up

My time at OERT covers in particular the phase of commissioning of the AC75 and participation in the 37th America’s Cup.

## **Education**

### **2020–2024 — École Normale Supérieure, Paris**

- **Master ICFP**: Fundamental Physics (quantum physics major)  
- **Bachelor’s degree**: Fundamental Physics

**Main subjects:**

**Physics:** quantum physics, statistical physics, solid‑state physics, special relativity, quantum field theory, general relativity, fluid mechanics.  
**Computer science / numerical methods:** numerical methods for partial differential equations, machine learning.  
**Mathematics:** statistics, probability, optimization, algebra, analysis.

## **Projects**

### SailCV

Motivated by my experience in the sailing world, I am developing in my spare time an embedded computer‑vision project dedicated to aerodynamic measurements.

The project is divided into two sub‑projects:

**SailCV‑tell‑tale‑tracker**

Design of a tell‑tale tracker to monitor boundary‑layer separation. Creation of a dataset and fine‑tuning of a detector.

**SailCV‑3D‑reconstruction**

This project aims to accurately reconstruct metric point clouds from calibrated stereo views. It is based on two main components:
- the ability of recent AI models dedicated to 3D reconstruction to predict dense point correspondences between two views of the same object;  
- precise calibration of the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a dual‑camera system, enabling accurate triangulation.
